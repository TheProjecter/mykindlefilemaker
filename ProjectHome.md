Not able to make your interested content on your kindle with perfect format?
You want read everything with your kindle?

By using this application, you can make any online text contents into your kindle, simply by just a click.

Kindle is a cool device, i really like it, I want to read everything on it;
however, the content are limited, e.g. I want to read the posts of an online form once a day on subway.
Nobody care your demand, you must do yourself, you should get online with your laptop and copy all content
post by post, page by page and put then into a ms word archive. And generate PDF file
(because kindle not accept MS word archive). Then use a cable connect your kindle with your laptop,
put the PDF file into your kindle. And the miserable thing is, if you just generate a common size of PDF file
, it will be too big to your kindle screen, and kindle is not good for zoom in zoom out like you read a PDF with
> your iPhone device. (because for reason kindle will treat your PDF file as pictures, you can not adjust the font size)

The idea for this application is
first getting articals from the Internet and gerenating a simple html for it.
second use kinlegen use the html file which we generated previously to generate a .mobi file.
third send a email to user's kindle mail box and attache the .mobi file.
fourth, get your kindle device switch on, synchronise, then you can get your articals.




You can download this project and simply run the main.java file , it will generate the .mobi for you.
